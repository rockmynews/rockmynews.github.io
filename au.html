"<strike>When I look up in the sky, I see the same star as you do.</strike> You couldn't be very far."

No matter how many times I meet, I am nervous.<strike> There is this eternal chance of things going any which way.</strike>

It's a rather odd risk to take.

<strike>Let me make one thing very clear. Risk isn't the word I wish to use. In Norwegian language they have this word; forelsket. It roughly translates to "the beginning (euphoric feeling ) of falling in love".</strike> Sometimes we are limited by language and other by ourselves. <strike>Decide which.</strike>

Things are fine until you meet. There is a chance of things going bad, or good. Would you meet? <strike>The problem isn't things going good.</strike> It is the bad part.

Would you risk everything you have for the good that does not and might never exist?

--
<strike>"What do you like to do?"</strike>
nothing
<strike>"same"</strike>
--

You're sitting silently. <strike>Hoping</strike> the other would break silence.<strike> Both</strike> thinking the same, until one does. <strike>Neither</strike> wishing to disturb the moment.

<strike>Saying nothing. Modest movement. Occasional look.</strike>

<strike>Things cannot go wrong here.</strike> It is constant, yet changing. On the outside it looks like nothing is happening. But in the end when you get up, you will not know what, but things will have changed. Subtle yet prevalent.
--

We walk. <strike>Nowhere. Everywhere.</strike> Filling the gaps of silence, with words.<strike> Every so realizing that gaps of silence aren't meant to be filled. We don't really go anywhere. But when we stop we realize that we've traveled a lot. Not of roads but ourselves.</strike>
--

<strike>Alone in a foreign place. It is of note to say alone when there are two. Everything around seems foreign. Nothing of your own. Nothing to comfort.

Maybe we talk because of this. There is only one another. We talk because we have to. But I do not see why that should be the case. A chance to not talk is ever present. To get away from.</strike>
--

When one decides for another, they have to decide thoroughly. One can seldom do that unless they are there all along.
--

You think things are bad. Things should have been better. Bring it to a perfect start. Even the most perfect sculpture has an imperfect part in it.

We try to forget things. Not they are unimportant. Because they are important. We cannot forget it. We try to forget.
--
<strike>Pause.</strike>

This is important to be. Increasingly so. Words seem to loose value as we find out that it did not mean what it meant. This happens when you find out that it was a lie. It holds value up until the lie. Then it looses its meaning thus its importance.

Pausing helps me look at things from a distance and think about it's true nature. If we were to look at ourselves, the best way would be to get out of ourselves and look.

<strike>Things are said from time to time. If you look back at it and then recall, you will realize a very important thing. They don't last. The things that were said were for that time, moment. You will only find a handful things that stand the test of time.</strike>

You sit with a person and at the end of the talk, you will have said many things. But years from now you recall that and that will have lost its value.

You will get a reply of it being so in the past. Yeah. It was nice. But it was back then. When that happened.

<strike>But you look at the most important things that have shaped your life, changed the course. They somehow seem abrupt. Seems like you saw it coming, yet sudden.

Those things have less of context and more of meaning. It remains for what was said.

It meant. It means.</strike>
--

<strike>Things in life are distant. Life itself seems too distant to make anything of it, yet it is finite. The stars seem infinite, yet countable. Odd.</strike>

**
<strike>Next time you see a shooting star, ask for something else.</strike>

"<strike>Nice.</strike> You think too much."
