         <p>#September 23</p>
         <p>So be it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#June 1</p>
         <p>Thinking about something from the previous page while on the next and reading(and thinking). What is actually being done.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p> #May 10</p>
         <p>Things do seem to have changed. Things that I used to do seem foreign now. It would take much more energy to do them now.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I thought of the results too fast. Achieving consistency is going to be ever ongoing. Years of accumulation. It cannot be in bits. Big and consistent.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Exposure will either deteriorate or strengthen.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Falling oil does not make sound. Water does. Streams are orchestra.</p>
         <p>#April 15</p>
         <p>I have changed. I think so. I do not know how I would be able to go back to my former self. I don’t even want to. Undergoing a personality change wasn’t as scary as I had once thought. Things are just more pleasant and calm. Not fun to disappoint people. But they’ll get used to it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Focus and consistency are really underrated. It seems that one helps the other. Though rituals and routines might not be liked they help create a process that helps do things. It gets us in the mode. One day focus is not good. And consistent wavered work is no good.</p>
         <p>Consistency and focus seem a good combination.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Things are never what they seem they are. People are never what they seem they are. Perception is different than reality. Getting to the real of things and people is not easy. As Russell said “people would rather die than think”, seems true. Overcome the illusion.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#March 6</p>
         <p>Why do I fight with people I like? Is it me or just how things are? Maybe because I do not talk to many people I feel I do with many. Would I be doing this with all if I talked to all? I don’t know. I doubt it. This is highly consistent.</p>
         <p>Things are changing fast. If I am consistent the change will be normal. Then. Things would actually have changed. Are you allowed to like someone irrationally? How can I be distant, detached and yet liking at the same time?</p>
         <p>I think wiping a child poop really keeps you grounded. I need to learn to talk less. A lot less. I don’t get into too many troubles when I don’t speak. Though some would disagree.</p>

         <p>#July 24</p>
         <p>We see things based on what we have learnt. We think it must be a snake. Upon light turns into a rope. Sounds like someone scrubbing something. Upon look a bee desperately buzzing around the window. Very deceived.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#July 20</p>
         <p>Cheetahs are fast. Humans are not. Some are. Some are not. Or most are not. It does seem such that there is not much difference in humans and other species. We might say that all humans have them, some simply do not have them due to various reasons. Similar to how not all cheetahs might run fast. Some exceptions might occur with them.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Humans seem to have their own level. For everything. All seem to have their thing. Cheetahs are fast. Some humans are fast. Sheeps are slow. Some humans are slow. Some animals are smart. Some humans are smart. Some animals are stupid. Some humans are stupid. Quite varying.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#July 19</p>
         <p>Patterns hide things. Order hides things.         We get used to it. We become blind to it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#July 17</p>
         <p>Impulse decisions seem impulse. Some are. Some aren&#39;t. They are less impulse and more outbursts. Outbursts of many previous thoughts. But it is good to wait out if possible and see what will happen if that is done. By then it won&#39;t be impulse but it will be much more consequential. </p>
         <p></p>

         <p>#June 25</p>
         <p>Note:</p>
         <p>Luck works backward. Not forward. It means that something did not happen because we wanted it. It just so happened that it happened and we wanted it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Fermenting is an elegant display of time doing it wonders. You let time do what it does, day by day, slowly. That happens to humans as well. More to some than others. And of different kinds. You however do have to put the initial things in place for things to ferment. It then decides what will happen, and how much depending upon time and condition.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>I need to stop talking to myself and think.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>What makes someone active? Some people do things then and there. I keep it off. I then might face problems when time does not favor me. Why will I not do things now and keep it for later? Laziness? But that is an outcome. That is the result. What causes that? Why am I so?</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Doing one thing at time really gets things done. Doing more than one thing at a time should be kept for things that are not important at all, but yet must be done. Things that might not require thinking at all</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#June 24 2017, 00:27</p>
         <p>We had to keep a daily diary compulsorily while at school. One day the teacher who would check(yes it was part of a subject and would be checked, everyday) addressed us frustrated. I remember him saying daily diary does not mean that you write what you do daily. All of us did that. One page was the copy of the previous one. Today&#39;s was a copy of yesterday. Tomorrow&#39;s a copy of today. Almost. He then said that we could write what we learnt that day. Or something that happened. That was a great idea. I, or anyone had not thought of it. We wrote our daily routine in our daily diary. He made us reconsider that. It must have been a part of it being forced unto us that kept me away. It happened later with &quot;must read books&quot;. Two great ideas, I kept away.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Truth is important. When you create doubt about a truth, you in a way hide it. You create a lie for yourself. &quot;Neither&quot; at times seems to be a lie.</p>

         <p>#April 16</p>
         <p><span>Simple ideas are not simple. They are abstractions to big ideas. Most of the simple ideas are called simple because they seem to be explainable in a <span class="c2">simple way. Einstein’s theory of seems complex. But when explained with an example(a metaphor), it becomes a simple idea. Simple ideas in hindsight seem obvious. But the lack knowledge until that point questions the simplistic nature of it. Fire once discovered seemed normal. But how simple is fire? Maybe they are simple.</p>
         <p>#April 7</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>When you want to tell things, at times when people know, it might backfire. What you want them is to listen, but we develop this habit of answering, somehow, something, regardless, whatever. I guess that is what childrens don’t do. They listen and question, repeatedly. We know they don’t know. We might know what they know. The beginner’s mind. We could take a look at a situation in two ways. As is. And with many others things we know.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>#February 6</p>
         <p>Present is good. I do not know when it has not been such. It’s the future that gets me. A day is not much. But Seven not much makes a week. Four Seven not much makes a month. Twelve Four Seven not much makes a year. How fast is that.</p>
         <p>People think I know what I am doing. Maybe more than some. Not much really.</p>

         <p></p>
         <p>January and February used to be the last two months of the year instead of the first two. That&#39;s why sept(7)ember octo(8)ber nov(9)ember and dec(10)ember are named the way they are (they used to be the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th months). Also leap years used to just add an extra day at the end of the year instead of on the end of the second month of the year, and February is the shortest month because it was the last month of the year.</p>

         <p>We tell lies to ourselves and also to others. We say to them that we do not worry about it and that it doesn’t change things, but it does. We say we are okay with things being their own way but when things change we aren’t okay.  “oh, so that’s how it is”.</p>

         <p>Everyday can be a good day. We many times forget that ultimately we affect ourselves more than the incidents or events that happen over the hours of day. Reaction to things vary from one to another which is normal. But that shows us that we respond to the same thing differently, with a different outlook.</p>

         <p></p>
         <p>Re + Act</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>We react based on how we are. Emphasis on we. Action could be any but the reaction is ours. Therefore at times we should unquestionably stop and rethink our reaction and recede if needed.</p>

         <p>#December</p>
         <p>we run down the hill. We see things beside us. There is nothing such as having it. It too is running. Once we let go of it the harder it becomes to catch it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>---</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Another day comes to an end. Things move fast in a way that one can never really grasp about if they are wasting it. I think one cannot really grasp anything if they are wasting it. There lies a path to finding its true value only by fully utilizing it.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>If things were only good, life would be much easier, or so they say. But when so is happening to one all the cry is about how everyday repeats like the previous one. It would not be fun to watch a fish go only in one direction.</p>

         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Failure is a tool. It is something that you always need to do something better. Failure is generally taken negatively which might be how it is instilled upon us. The concept of failure is given in school where teachers frame it poorly. If you cannot get the bare minimum it is termed failure. The worst part is however the reasoning, you were dumb or could not do well. Failing is not about losing, it is about learning. </p>
         <p></p>
         <p>The perception that failure is bad makes one feel ashamed. This causes people to try less which ultimately makes people take less risks. Everything new is risky. Anything done first time can cause failure. But the way one accepts what failure is makes them accept only the minimum that others think that one should fail in. You would never call a one year old falling from standing a failure, would you?</p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Risk is rewarding. It gives us experience,fail or succeed. When we take risk it is all about doing something new or extra, of whose results are not known. There is nothing bad with trying something new or extra. It is people’s idea that taking risk is harmful that makes people do nothing resulting in not being wise. Experiences come out of events which occur due to risk taking adventures. When risk are not taking things remain the same, empty. It is always good to try something new, fail or not you will for sure turn out wise having learnt the lesson.</p>

         <p>====================</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Not investing in Gold</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Long time ago I asked to a person what inflation was. I got a good answer; inflation is increasing of price while the value of something is same. I also learnt that the person was buying gold and silver; kind of like investing. I thought that wasn&#39;t great because stocks offer great return if done nicely. The reasoning was that the price of gold always increases which is safe and great.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Some time ago I was listening to people talk about the value of money decades ago and what it could buy. It made me think if gold was really a good &#39;investment&#39;. I realised that on the surface the price of gold increases, actually price of everything increases. To understand if very long term investment in gold is worth it, we need to compare it with something.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Current year: 2015</p>
         <p>1 ounce gold = $100 . This is what you bought for a very long term investment.</p>
         <p>1 pound coca = $10 . This is what it costs in the market if you want to buy.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>You can buy 10 pounds of coca with $100</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>10 years later: 2025.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Price of gold has increased 20%.</p>
         <p>Price of coca has increased 10%.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>Your $100 investment in gold has become worth $120. Not that bad.</p>
         <p>The price of coca has increased to $11. Not great but you can afford.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>How much coca can you buy with your $120 dollars now?</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>1 pound coca = $11</p>
         <p>You have $120</p>
         <p>You can buy 10.9 pounds of coca with $120. Not even 11 pounds, but almost.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>How would you feel if your 10 year investment could not even buy you 1 more pound of coca? This is the issue, people tend to look only at what they like. They forget that there is an environment around it and many factors to influence it, good or bad. Your investment becomes more valuable but so does the shampoo and your toothbrush.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There are people however who must be investing in gold and earning good money. The difference between you and the person is that people has researched about it and knows way more about not just gold, but factors around gold. You on the other hand are busy spending days researching which oven is better while dumping money without knowledge in gold, calling if safe.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There are things all around. Good and bad. High and lows. We get to choose. And we do.</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>============================</p>
         <p></p>
         <p>There is so little time. Too much to do. As I write and you read this, there are a lot of things that are being put off. Not being done. However we console ourselves thinking we have started or at least thought of doing it. In the end we have to decide what to do. Also deciding what not to do. Equally important in the infinite garbage pool of thoughts.</p>
         <p>If thinking was enough, I&#39;d be dead.</p>
         <p></p>
