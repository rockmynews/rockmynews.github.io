                “In fact once Swami told out of one incident that happened on 1991, not a pleasant one. Swami said I was physically present there when this event was happening in your life. It had to happen. That’s why I did not intervene.”
            </p>

            <p>
                “On another occasion Swami was interacting with us. Swami said that look please understand, <i>once you surrender to Me, I will never allow anything wrong to happen to you</i>. Please take it whatever happens is good for your life. Only good for your life.”
            </p>
            </p>
            “Once Swami also said… even in your dream, even by mistake, you say once, Swami I’m yours. You are mine. And after making this statement he says sorry sorry Swami I made a mistake I want to withdraw this statement. Swami says, once it has come out of your lips, I will hold on to you for rest of the time. You are under me. You cannot be out of me.”

                "This happened in Kodaikanal in one of our visits with Swami. There was a student who passed out with MSC Chemistry from the institute and he was working in Mysore in the central food technology research institute lab which is there. And all of us know and many of us who have heard would know seeing Swami in Kodaikanal and experiencing Swami in Kodaikanal or being part of the entourage of Swami in Kodaikonal is something which is beyond description."
            </p>
            <p>
                "So all old students who wanted,who did not have an opportunity to go with Swami, they all tried to come. So this boy also had come and you know these places don’t pay very much. So whatever money he was able to save he brought the money and stayed. And Kodaikonal is very expensive. Money was almost getting over whatever he brought. Maybe one more day he could stay and go back. So previous day he was holding a letter for Swami. Swami did not take the letter."
            </p>
            <p>
                “Then Swami called him to come to Sai Sruti inside along with the other boys. Swami was talking and then called the boy and said, (...) from this stack of letters take any one letter, pull out one letter. So the boy looked at and pulled out a letter. And then Swami said open the letter. So he opened the one edge(of the letter). Then Swami said take out what is inside.So he put his finger inside and pulled out and from there inside came a 500 rupee note. Then Swami looked at him and said, this is what you asked for isn’t it? You wanted 500 rupees so that you can stay few more days. Take it. He was so very happy. The boy was happy. Then Swami said, you asked for 500 I gave 500. But suppose you had asked me, Swami I want to stay, please take care of me. I would have given all the money which is needed for you to stay here.”

                “Allow him to decide what should be bestowed upon us. We should not seek what we want.”
