One of Leibowitz’s favorite stories was about a donkey placed equidistant from two bundles of hay. In the story the donkey can’t decide which bundle of hay is closer to him, and so dies of hunger. “Leibowitz would then say that no donkey would do this; a donkey would just go at random to one or the other and eat. It’s only when decisions are made by people that they get more complicated. And then he said, ‘What happens to a country when a donkey makes the decisions that people are supposed to make you can read every day in the paper.’

Thorndike asked U.S. Army officers to rate their men according to some physical trait (“physique,” for example) and then assess some less tangible quality (“intelligence,” “leadership,” and so forth). He discovered that the feeling created by making the first ranking bled into the second: If an officer thought a soldier physically impressive, he also found him impressive in other ways. Switch the order of assessment, and the same problem occurred: If a person was first judged to be generally great, he was then judged to be stronger than he actually was. “Obviously a halo of general merit is extended to influence the rating for the special ability, or vice versa,” Thorndike concluded; he went on to say that he had “become convinced that even a very capable foreman, employer, teacher, or department head is unable to view an individual as a compound of separate qualities and to assign a magnitude to each of these in independence of the others.”

Amos was fond of saying that interesting things happened to people who could weave them into interesting stories.
==========

What all those who came to know Amos eventually realized was that the man had a preternatural gift for doing only precisely what he wanted to do. Varda Liberman recalled visiting him one day and seeing a table with a week’s worth of mail on it. There were tidy little stacks, one for each day, each filled with requests and entreaties and demands upon Amos’s time: job offers, offers of honorary degrees, requests for interviews and lectures, requests for help with some abstruse problem, bills. When the new mail came in Amos opened anything that interested him and left the rest in its daily pile. Each day the new mail arrived and shoved the old mail down the table. When a pile reached the end of the table Amos pushed it, unopened, off the edge into a waiting garbage can.

“The nice thing about things that are urgent,” he liked to say, “is that if you wait long enough they aren’t urgent anymore.” “I would say to Amos I have to do this or I have to do that,” recalled his old friend Yeshu Kolodny. “And he would say, ‘No. You don’t.’ And I thought: lucky man!”
There was this beautiful simplicity to Amos: His likes and dislikes could be inferred directly and accurately and at all times from his actions. Amos’s three children have vivid memories of watching their parents drive off to see some movie picked by their mother, only to have their father turn up back at their couch twenty minutes later. Amos would have decided, in the first five minutes, whether the movie was worth seeing—and if it wasn’t he’d just come home and watch Hill Street Blues (his favorite TV drama) or Saturday Night Live (he never missed it) or an NBA game (he was obsessed with basketball). He’d then go back and fetch his wife after her movie ended. “They’ve already taken my money,” he’d explain. “Should I give them my time, too?” If by some freak accident he found himself at a gathering of his fellow human beings that held no appeal for him, he’d become invisible. “He’d walk into a room and decide he didn’t want anything to do with it and he would fade into the background and just vanish,” says Dona. “It was like a superpower. And it was absolutely an abnegation of social responsibility. He didn’t accept social responsibility—and so graciously, so elegantly, didn’t accept it.”
Occasionally Amos offended someone—of course he did. His darting pale blue eyes were enough to unsettle people who didn’t know him. Their constant motion gave them the impression he wasn’t listening to them, when the problem, often, was that he had listened too well. “For him the main thing is the people who don’t know the difference between knowing and not knowing,” says Avishai Margalit. “If he thought you were a bore and there was nothing there, he could cut you like nothing.” Those who knew him best learned how to rationalize whatever he had said or done.
It never occurred to him that anyone with whom he wanted to spend time wouldn’t want to spend time with him. “He expected first of all to charm you,” said Samuel Sattath. “Which was odd for such a smart person.” “He sort of invited people to love him,” said Yeshu Kolodny. “When you were on the good side of Amos he was very easy to love. Extremely easy. There was a competition around him. People competed for Amos.” It was a very common thing for Amos’s friends to ask themselves: I know why I like him, but why does he like me?

People said some strange things. For instance, they said that magenta was similar to red, but that red wasn’t similar to magenta. Amos spotted the contradiction and set out to generalize it. He asked people if they thought North Korea was like Red
==========

China. They said yes. He asked them if Red China was like North Korea—and they said no. People thought Tel Aviv was like New York but that New York was not like Tel Aviv. People thought that the number 103 was sort of like the number 100, but that 100 wasn’t like 103. People thought a toy train was a lot like a real train but that a real train was not like a toy train. People often thought that a son resembled his father, but if you asked them if the father resembled his son, they just looked at you strangely.

Many have tried. Before he traveled to Stanford in the 1980s to study for his doctorate with Amos, Rich Gonzalez had read “Features of Similarity” several times. Upon arrival, he found his way to Amos’s office, introduced himself, and asked what he thought was a killer question: “What about a three-legged dog?” Two three-legged dogs are obviously more similar to each other than a three-legged dog is to a four-legged dog. Yet a three-legged dog shares exactly the same number of features with a four-legged dog as it does with a three-legged dog. Ergo, an exception to Amos’s theory! “I went in thinking, ‘I’m outsmarting Amos,’” recalls Gonzalez. “He just looked at me like, Really? That’s the best you can come up with? I think there might have been an initial glare, but then he was nice about it—and he said, ‘The absence of a feature is a feature.’” Amos had written that into his original paper. “Similarity increases with the addition of common features and/or deletion of distinctive features.”
==========

By changing the context in which two things are compared, you submerge certain features and force others to the surface. “It is generally assumed that classifications are determined by similarities among the objects,” wrote Amos, before offering up an opposing view: that “the similarity of objects is modified by the manner in which they are classified. Thus, similarity has two faces: causal and derivative. It serves as a basis for the classification of objects, but is also influenced by the adopted classification.” A banana and an apple seem more similar than they otherwise would because we’ve agreed to call them both fruit. Things are grouped together for a reason, but, once they are grouped, their grouping causes them to seem more like each other than they otherwise would. That is, the mere act of classification reinforces stereotypes. If you want to weaken some stereotype, eliminate the classification.

You find a paradigm that is out there. You find a general proposition of that paradigm. And you destroy it. He saw himself doing a negative style of science. He used the word a lot: negative. This turns out to be a very powerful way of doing social science.” That’s how Amos would begin: by undoing the mistakes of others. As it turned out, other people had made some other mistakes.

The psychologist Kurt Lewin had suggested persuasively that, rather than selling people on some change, you were better off identifying the reasons for their resistance, and addressing those.

This is what happens when people become attached to a theory. They fit the evidence to the theory rather than the theory to the evidence. They cease to see what’s right under their nose.

When you are a pessimist and the bad thing happens, you live it twice, Amos liked to say. Once when you worry about it, and the second time when it happens.

People mistook even a very small part of a thing for the whole. Even statisticians tended to leap to conclusions from inconclusively small amounts of evidence. They did this, Amos and Danny argued, because they believed—even if they did not acknowledge the belief—that any given sample of a large population was more representative of that population than it actually was.
==========

The natural next question: When does our rule-of-thumb approach to calculating the odds lead to serious miscalculation? One answer was: Whenever people are asked to evaluate anything with a random component to it. It wasn’t enough that the uncertain event being judged resembled the parent population, wrote Danny and Amos. “The event should also reflect the properties of the uncertain process by which it is generated.” That is, if a process is random, its outcome should appear random. They didn’t explain how people’s mental model of “randomness” was formed in the first place. Instead they said, Let’s look at judgments that involve randomness, because we psychologists can all pretty much agree on people’s mental model of it.
==========

People find it a remarkable coincidence when two students in the same classroom share a birthday, when in fact there is a better than even chance, in any group of twenty-three people, that two of its members will have been born on the same day. We have a kind of stereotype of “randomness” that differs from true randomness. Our stereotype of randomness lacks the clusters and patterns that occur in true random sequences.

For instance, after they drove past a gruesome car crash on the highway, they slowed down: Their sense of the odds of being in a crash had changed. After seeing a movie that dramatizes nuclear war, they worried more about nuclear war; indeed, they felt that it was more likely to happen. The sheer volatility of people’s judgment of the odds—their sense of the odds could be changed by two hours in a movie theater—told you something about the reliability of the mechanism that judged those odds.

They read lists of people’s names to Oregon students, for instance. Thirty-nine names, read at a rate of two seconds per name. The names were all easily identifiable as male or female. A few were the names of famous people—Elisabeth Taylor, Richard Nixon. A few were names of slightly less famous people—Lana Turner, William Fulbright. One list consisted of nineteen male names and twenty female names, the other of twenty female names and nineteen male names. The list that had more female names on it had more names of famous men, and the list that had more male names on it contained the names of more famous women. The unsuspecting Oregon students, having listened to a list, were then asked to judge if it contained the names of more men or more women. They almost always got it backward: If the list had more male names on it, but the women’s names were famous, they thought the list contained more female names, and vice versa. “Each of the problems had an objectively correct answer,” Amos and Danny wrote, after they were done with their strange mini-experiments.
==========

The point, once again, wasn’t that people were stupid. This particular rule they used to judge probabilities (the easier it is for me to retrieve from my memory, the more likely it is) often worked well. But if you presented people with situations in which the evidence they needed to judge them accurately was hard for them to retrieve from their memories, and misleading evidence came easily to mind, they made mistakes. “Consequently,” Amos and Danny wrote, “the use of the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases.” Human judgment was distorted by . . . the memorable.

A human being who finds himself stuck at some boring meeting or cocktail party often finds it difficult to invent an excuse to flee. Amos’s rule, whenever he wanted to leave any gathering, was to just get up and leave. Just start walking and you’ll be surprised how creative you will become and how fast you’ll find the words for your excuse, he said.

Amos liked to say that if you are asked to do anything—go to a party, give a speech, lift a finger—you should never answer right away, even if you are sure that you want to do it. Wait a day, Amos said, and you’ll be amazed how many of those invitations you would have accepted yesterday you’ll refuse after you have had a day to think it over.

People predict by making up stories People predict very little and explain everything People live under uncertainty whether they like it or not People believe they can tell the future if they work hard enough People accept any explanation as long as it fits the facts The handwriting was on the wall, it was just the ink that was invisible People often work hard to obtain information they already have And avoid new knowledge Man is a deterministic device thrown into a probabilistic Universe In this match, surprises are expected Everything that has already happened must have been inevitable

“Evidently, people respond differently when given no specific evidence and when given worthless evidence,” wrote Danny and Amos. “When no specific evidence is given, the prior probabilities are properly utilized; when worthless specific evidence is given, prior probabilities are ignored.”

In his talk to the historians, Amos described their occupational hazard: the tendency to take whatever facts they had observed (neglecting the many facts that they did not or could not observe) and make them fit neatly into a confident-sounding story:

Later Redelmeier said as much to one of his fellow students, an American. What is it with you freedom-loving Americans? he asked. Live free or die. I don’t get it. I say, “Regulate me gently. I’d rather live.” His fellow student replied, Not only do a lot of Americans not share your view; other physicians don’t share your view. Redelmeier’s fellow student told him about Stanford’s famous head of cardiac surgery, Norm Shumway, who had actively lobbied against the creation of a law that would require motorcyclists to wear helmets.

Surgery was more likely to extend your life, but, unlike radiation, it came with the small risk of instant death. When you told people that they had a 90 percent chance of surviving surgery, 82 percent of patients opted for surgery. But when you told them that they had a 10 percent chance of dying from the surgery—which was of course just a different way of putting the same odds—only 54 percent chose the surgery. People facing a life-and-death decision responded not to the odds but to the way the odds were described to them.

A part of good science is to see what everyone else can see but think what no one else has ever said. The difference between being very smart and very foolish is often very small. So many problems occur when people fail to be obedient when they are supposed to be obedient, and fail to be creative when they are supposed to be creative. The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours. It is sometimes easier to make the world a better place than to prove you have made the world a better place.

Watch any NBA game, Amos explained to Redelmeier, and you saw that the announcers, the fans, and maybe even the coaches seemed to believe that basketball shooters had the “hot hand.” Simply because some player had made his last few shots, he was thought to be more likely to make his next shot. Amos had collected data on NBA shooting streaks to see if the so-called hot hand was statistically significant—he already could persuade you that it was not. A better shooter was of course more likely to make his next shot than a less able shooter, but the streaks observed by fans and announcers and the players themselves were illusions. He asked Redelmeier to find in medicine the same sort of false pattern–seeking behavior exhibited by basketball announcers.

Where were you? What did you do? What did you see? Was the battle a success? If not, why not? “People started to talk about fear,” recalls Yaffa Singer. “About their emotions. From the war of independence until 1973 it hadn’t been allowed. We are supermen. No one has the guts to talk about fear. If we talk about it maybe we won’t survive.”

He didn’t really want to be in the Sinai anyway, not in the way Amos seemed to want to be there. “I remember a sense of futility—that we were wasting our time there,” he said. When their jeep bounced once too often and caused Danny’s back to go out, he quit the journey—and left Amos alone to administer the questionnaires. From their jeep rides he retained a single vivid memory. “We went to sleep near a tank,” he recalled. “On the ground. And Amos didn’t like where I was sleeping, because he thought the tank might move and crush me. And I remember being very, very touched by this. It was not sensible advice. A tank makes a lot of noise. But that he was worried about me.”

Where were you? What did you do? What did you see? Was the battle a success? If not, why not? “People started to talk about fear,” recalls Yaffa Singer. “About their emotions. From the war of independence until 1973 it hadn’t been allowed. We are supermen. No one has the guts to talk about fear. If we talk about it maybe we won’t survive.” For days after the war, Amos sat with Singer and two other colleagues in the psychology field unit and read through the soldiers’ answers to his questions. They spoke of their motives for fighting. “It’s such horrible information that people tend to bury it,” said Singer. But caught fresh, the soldiers revealed to the psychologists sentiments that, in retrospect, seemed blindingly obvious. “We asked, why is anyone fighting for Israel?” said Singer. “Until that moment we were just patriots. When we started reading the questionnaires it was so obvious: They were fighting for their friends. Or for their families. Not for the nation. Not for Zionism. At the time it was a huge realization.” Perhaps for the first time, Israeli soldiers spoke openly of their feelings, as they watched five of their beloved platoon mates blown to bits or as they saw their best friend on earth killed because he turned left when he was supposed to turn right. “It was heartbreaking to read them,” said Singer.

Arriving at the Suez, Amos found that the shelling hadn’t merely continued; it had intensified. There was now a long-standing tradition, on both sides of any Arab-Israeli war, of seizing the moment immediately before a formal cease-fire to fire any remaining ammunition at each other. The spirit of the thing was: Kill as many of them as you can, while you can. Wandering around near the Suez Canal and sensing an incoming missile, Amos leapt into a trench and landed on top of an Israeli soldier. Are you a bomb? asked the terrified soldier. No, I’m Amos, said Amos. So I’m not dead? asked the soldier. You’re not dead, said Amos. That was the one story Amos told. Apart from that, he seldom mentioned the war again.
==========


In 1974, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had served as the middleman in peace negotiations between Israel and Egypt and between Israel and Syria. As a prod to action, Kissinger had sent the Israeli government the CIA’s assessment that, if the attempt to make peace failed, very bad events were likely to follow. Danny and Lanir set out to give Israeli foreign minister Yigal Allon and the director-general of the ministry precise numerical estimates of the likelihood of some very specific bad things happening. They assembled a list of possible “critical events or concerns”: regime change in Jordan, U.S. recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization, another full-scale war with Syria, and so on. They then surveyed experts and well-informed observers to establish the likelihood of each event. Among these people, they found a remarkable consensus: There wasn’t a lot of disagreement about the odds. When Danny asked the experts what the effect might be of the failure of Kissinger’s negotiations on the probability of war with Syria, for instance, their answers clustered around “raises the chance of war by 10 percent.” Danny and Lanir then presented their probabilities to Israel’s Foreign Ministry. (“The National Gamble,” they called their report.) The director-general looked at the numbers and said, “10 percent increase?—that is a small difference.” Danny was stunned: If a 10 percent increase in the chances of full-scale war with Syria wasn’t enough to interest the director-general in Kissinger’s peace process, how much would it take to convince him? That number represented the best estimate of the odds. Apparently the director-general didn’t want to rely on the best estimates. He preferred his own internal probability calculator: his gut. “That was the moment I gave up on decision analysis,” said Danny. “No one ever made a decision because of a number. They need a story.” As Danny and Lanir wrote, decades later, after the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency asked them to describe their experience in decision analysis, the Israeli Foreign Ministry was “indifferent to the specific probabilities.” What was the point of laying out the odds of a gamble, if the person taking it either didn’t believe the numbers or didn’t want to know them? The trouble, Danny suspected, was that “the understanding of numbers is so weak that they don’t communicate anything. Everyone feels that those probabilities are not real—that they are just something on somebody’s mind.”

Only that the theory seemed to describe some of what people did in the real world, with real money. It explained the desire to buy insurance. It distinctly did not explain the human desire to buy a lottery ticket, however. It effectively turned a blind eye to gambling. Odd this, as the search for a theory about how people made risky decisions had started as an attempt to make Frenchmen shrewder gamblers.
==========


Danny wrote to Amos, in one of a series of memos on the subject. “It is the anticipation of regret that affects decisions, along with the anticipation of other consequences.” Danny thought that people anticipated regret, and adjusted for it, in a way they did not anticipate or adjust for other emotions. “What might have been is an essential component of misery,’” he wrote to Amos. “There is an asymmetry here, because considerations of how much worse things could have been is not a salient factor in human joy and happiness.” Happy people did not dwell on some imagined unhappiness the way unhappy people imagined what they might have done differently so that they might be happy. People did not seek to avoid other emotions with the same energy they sought to avoid regret.

You have participated in a lottery at a fair, and have bought a single expensive ticket in the hope of winning the single large prize that is offered. The ticket was drawn blindly from a large urn, and its number is 107358. The results of the lottery are now announced, and it turns out that the winning number is 107359. They asked their subjects to rate their unhappiness on a scale from 1 to 20. Then they went to two other groups of subjects and gave them the same scenario, but with one change: the winning number. One group of subjects was told that the winning number was 207358; the second group was told that the winning number was 618379. The first group professed greater unhappiness than the second. Weirdly—but as Danny and Amos had suspected—the further the winning number was from the number on a person’s lottery ticket, the less regret they felt.
==========


War and politics were never far from Amos and Danny’s minds or their conversations. They watched their fellow Israelis closely in the aftermath of the Yom Kippur war. Most regretted that Israel had been caught by surprise. Some regretted that Israel had not attacked first. Few

regretted what both Danny and Amos thought they should most regret: the Israeli government’s reluctance to give back the territorial gains from the 1967 war. Had Israel given back the Sinai to Egypt, Sadat would quite likely never have felt the need to attack in the first place. Why didn’t people regret Israel’s inaction? Amos and Danny had a thought: People regretted what they had done, and what they wished they hadn’t done, far more than what they had not done and perhaps should have. “The pain that is experienced when the loss is caused by an act that modified the status quo is significantly greater than the pain that is experienced when the decision led to the retention of the status quo,” Danny wrote in a memo to Amos. “When one fails to take action that could have avoided a disaster, one does not accept responsibility for the occurrence of the disaster.”
==========


Two decades later, in 1995, the American psychologist Thomas Gilovich, who collaborated in turn with Danny and Amos, coauthored a study that examined the relative happiness of silver and bronze medal winners at the 1992 Summer Olympics. From video footage, subjects judged the bronze medal winners to be happier than the silver medal winners. The silver medalists, the authors suggested, dealt with the regret of not having won gold, while the bronze medalists were just happy to be on a podium.
==========


A second rule: Regret was closely linked to feelings of responsibility. The more control you felt you had over the outcome of a gamble, the greater the regret you experienced if the gamble turned out badly. People anticipated regret in Allais’s problem not from the failure to win a gamble but from the decision to forgo a certain pile of money.

“Always keep one hand firmly on data,” Amos liked to say. Data was what set psychology apart from philosophy, and physics from metaphysics.

One day, toward the end of 1974, as they looked over the gambles they had put to their subjects, Amos asked, “What if we flipped the signs?” Till that point, the gambles had all involved choices between gains. Would you rather have $500 for sure or a 50-50 shot at $1,000? Now Amos asked, “What about losses?” As in: Which of the following do you prefer? Gift A: A lottery ticket that offers a 50 percent chance of losing $1,000 Gift B: A certain loss of $500 It was instantly obvious to them that if you stuck minus signs in front of all these hypothetical gambles and asked people to reconsider them, they behaved very differently than they had when faced
==========


with nothing but possible gains. “It was a eureka moment,” said Danny. “We immediately felt like fools for not thinking of that question earlier.” When you gave a person a choice between a gift of $500 and a 50-50 shot at winning $1,000, he picked the sure thing. Give that same person a choice between losing $500 for sure and a 50-50 risk of losing $1,000, and he took the bet. He became a risk seeker. The odds that people demanded to accept a certain loss over the chance of some greater loss crudely mirrored the odds they demanded to forgo a certain gain for the chance of a greater gain.
==========

“It reflects a general property of the human organism as a pleasure machine. For most people, the happiness involved in receiving a desirable object is smaller than the unhappiness involved in losing the same object.”
It wasn’t hard to imagine why this might be—a heightened sensitivity to pain was helpful to survival. “Happy species endowed with infinite appreciation of pleasures and low sensitivity to pain would probably not survive the evolutionary battle,” they wrote.
==========


Now they saw that people reacted differently to different degrees of uncertainty. When you gave them one bet with a 90 percent chance of working out and another with a 10 percent chance of working out, they did not behave as if the first was nine times as likely to work out as the second. They made some internal adjustment, and acted as if a 90 percent chance was actually slightly less than a 90 percent chance, and a 10 percent chance was slightly more than a 10 percent chance. They responded to probabilities not just with reason but with emotion.
==========


Danny and Amos were trying to show that people faced with a risky choice failed to put it in context. They evaluated it in isolation. In exploring what they now called the isolation effect, Amos and Danny had stumbled upon another idea—and its real-world implications were difficult to ignore. This one they called “framing.” Simply by changing the description of a situation, and making a gain seem like a loss, you could cause people to completely flip their attitude toward risk

“Psychologists as a rule will only interrupt a presentation for clarification,” says psychologist Dan Gilbert. “Economists will interrupt to show how smart they are.” “In economics it is completely normal to be rude,” says economist George Loewenstein. “We tried to create a psychology and economics seminar at Yale. We had our first meeting. The psychologists came out completely bruised. We never had a second meeting.” In the early 1990s, Amos’s former student Steven Sloman invited an equal number of economists and psychologists to a conference in France. “And I swear to God I spent three-quarters of my time telling the economists to shut up,” said Sloman. “The problem,” says Harvard social psychologist Amy Cuddy, “is that psychologists think economists are immoral and economists think psychologists are stupid.”
