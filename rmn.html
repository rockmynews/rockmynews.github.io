Moments turn into hours and hours into days, days into decade
You are kind to give some of these precious moments to me
They have come in many ways and have varied a lot 
But all are one in that it is you who gave them
This is not surprising as you are kind to all
You think otherwise but that changes nothing
You allow me to speak when I should stop
You take all the silence when I do not
These are not meant to be praises
These are who you really are
You bring a storm of calm
But a silent one though
And there you are
Absolute wonder
However things are
कहिले हास्दै कहिले जिस्क्यौदै
धेरै साल हरु बिते बित्ने छन् अझै
नसोचु तिमीलाई कसरी सोच्न मन लाग्छ
सुर्य जस्तै गरी आउचौ रात उज्यालो पार्न
सुर्य जस्तै गरीकसरी मन आउचौ रात उज्यालो पार्न
सुर्य मन मन मन जस्तै गरी आउचौ रात उज्यालो पार्न
समय को डुंगामा बग्दै छौ कहिले घाममा त कहिले भिज्दै 
तिमि जहाँ भए पनि तिम्रो मुस्कान को पछाडी म लुकी बस्ने छु
तिमी आफ्नो बाटो लाग तर घामलाई नहटाउ छाया बनी पछ्याउनेछु
सोच्छु कि कहिले सबै दिन्छु तिमिलाइ तर डर लाग्छ कि तिम्रो लागी न पुग्ला 
खाली कागज पठाउने छु तेस्लाई भरेर पठाऊ आफ्नो सपना हरु को चित्र ले भरिदेउ 
भन्नु धेरै छ भन्न आउदैन प्रयास नगरेको होइन कुनै दिन बुज्लौ नबुजे केहि छैन म हुने छु

25 years ago
  in 1996
August 27

You were born. Here. I would put a streetview link to where you were born(roughly?), but I don’t think it would please you. Skipped.

Now. I almost want to name this as 25 part two, for reasons you may remember. But I will go with 5X5 instead

5 x 5

This symphony has 5 sections.

Intro       :  Itsy bitsy don’t remember : Kalimati
Section 1 :  Chabahil
Section 2 :  School near home
Section 3 :  S4
Section 4 : High school and more
Section 5:  College and more


25 years have passed. When the hourglass is turned, I don’t know where I will land. But I will be there. Somewhere.

Despite all that happened or will, I am not worried. It’s one of those wonderful dreams that you wake up to. Disappointed that it ended but smiling it happened. The joy escapes the dream and lingers the day.

We both worry we will wake up. Forgetting we are not in one.

You will never know how I feel, for there is no another you.
When you asked for my number and we carried the conversation.
You singing my heart will go on
You wishing me birthday
You writing to me after earthquake
Everytime you ask if I’m back when I’m there.
Returning from saaga
You getting off the vehicle because you saw me
You being relieved that I passed my exams
You meeting to know what I’ll do after my 12th

One of the most memorable instance happened during our first interaction. we were sitting on that dhunge dhaara. you were on left. sitting crossed leg. i on right. legs down. we were sitting. just as we do today. but the silence were longer. timi tehi baseko thaau ma finger le dhulo yeta uota gari rakheko thiyau. you stopped instantly when i mentioned ki ~fohor huncha.

we had this question ki who are we. for each other. we were trying to figure what is going on. took a while. i remember saying you are like an anchor to me. i don't think it makes that much sense even now. i doubt it made any then.


You were wanted right from the beginning. You’ve been good literally from your birth. Remember after you were born the nurse asked if they could have you. Your mother did not agree. I am very pleased with her decision. I don’t know which school I would have had to be in to see you.
